## Blazor Hybrid Web Apps with .NET MAUI

Microsoft has introduced the highly anticipated Blazor framework in ASP.NET Core 3.0. In .NET 5.0, Blazor received significant updates to its component model, plus speed improvements and pre-rendering capabilities. Blazor's initial focus was to allow developers to target the browser using the .NET stack with little or no JavaScript required, all without a single browser plug-in. The key to Blazor's success is its ability to enable .NET developers by leveraging their existing skills. Using Blazor, .NET developers can build a full-stack application using only .NET technologies.

In .NET 6.0, the Blazor framework finds yet another path for developer success with .NET MAUI. MAUI provides a set of technologies that enable apps to run on Web, desktop, and mobile. This new pattern is named Blazor Hybrid and, once again, developers are empowered to use their existing skills to reach even more ecosystems. With Blazor Hybrid, native desktop on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows are now within reach.

## Sands of MAUI

Welcome to the Sands of MAUI—newsletter-style issues dedicated to bringing together latest .NET MAUI content relevant to developers. By [Sam Basu](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/author/sam-basu)

A particle of sand—tiny and innocuous. But put a lot of sand particles together and we have something big—a force to reckon with. It is the smallest grains of sand that often add up to form massive beaches, dunes and deserts.

Most .NET developers are looking forward to .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)—the evolution of Xamarin.Forms with .NET 6. Going forward, developers should have much more confidence in the technology stack and tools as .NET MAUI empowers native cross-platform solutions on mobile and desktop.

While it is a long flight until we reach the sands of MAUI, developer excitement is palpable in all the news/content as we tinker and prepare for .NET MAUI. Like the grains of sand, every piece of news/article/video/tutorial/stream contributes towards developer knowledge and we grow a community/ecosystem willing to learn and help.
