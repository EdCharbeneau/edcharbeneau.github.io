.NET Conf is a world wide event that takes place over three days. Sessions are streamed 24 hours a day for two solid days! With all of that content it's quite easy to miss out on something important. As a Blazor developer myself, I wanted to make sure I don't lose track of any important content and compiled a list of Blazor sessions that shouldn't be missed.

There's [amazing content in all 3 days of .NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda) and you will be able to catch it all on YouTube later. But if you're pressed for here is the **"Blazor track"**: 


## Tuesday, November 14

**11:00 AM - 12:00 PM EST** | **Welcome to .NET 8 (Keynote)** 

See the team behind .NET and learn about .NET 8 and the roadmap ahead.

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM EST** | **Full stack web UI with Blazor in .NET 8** 

Daniel Roth and Steve Sanderson talk about the new direction Blazor has taken with the "Blazor United" initiative. Blazor's capabilities have grown in .NET 8 offering static, server, and client rendering modes. This is the must see session for Blazor developers.

**2:00 PM - 3:00 PM EST** | **Performance Improvements in .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, and .NET MAUI**

Blazor has received performance improvements in .NET 8. This will likely be highlighted along with performance wins in other framework topics as well. AOT, JSON, JITerpreter, and WASM news is possible.

**3:00 PM - 3:45 PM EST** | **What's New in C# 12**

With Blazor being a full stack web UI, there is no doubt that C# 12 features will strengthen your Blazor skills.

## Wednesday, November 15

Wednesday marks the beginning of the first 24 hour stream. All presenters in this 24 hour period are Microsoft engineers or PMs.

**1:30 PM - 2:00 PM EST** | **In .NET 8, ASP.NET Ate**

Engineers from the .NET team working on things like Web API. We'll likely see new Minimal API features, tooling, etc.

**2:00 PM - 2:30 PM EST** | **What's new in System.Text.Json**

There's some cross over with Blazor here. If you're working with HttpClient or JavaScript interop JSON has some influence on your application and its performance.

**2:30 PM - 3:00 PM EST** | **Tiny, fast ASP.NET Core APIs with native AOT**

Native AOT apps have faster startup time and smaller memory footprints. These apps can run on machines that don't have the .NET runtime installed. AOT support in .NET 8 is more comprehensive than in .NET 7 and will likely influence Blazor.

**4:00 PM - 4:30 PM EST** | **Visual Studio Updates for .NET Devs**

If you're interested in Blazor and Blazor Hybrid make sure you tune in to see what **Dev Tunnels** is all about. 

**5:00 PM - 5:30 PM EST** | **ASP.NET Core Authentication Simplified**

Authentication should be easier in .NET 8, in addition to the new Identity Blazor Components. The Identity UI has been rewritten with Razor Components, making Identity seamless with Blazor.

**6:30 PM - 7:00 PM EST** | **Build hybrid apps with .NET MAUI**

Blazor Hybrid has massive potential for deploying to web, desktop and mobile from a single code base. If you're interested in cross platform development make sure you don't miss this session and hear about it directly from the engineering team.

## Thursday, November 16

Thursday marks the beginning of the second 24 hour stream. All presenters in this 24 hour period are community contributors, content creators, and MVPs.
**6:30 AM - 7:00 AM EST** | **Migrating a React Application to Blazor**

If you're coming from a React codebase to Blazor, this is the session for you.

**7:00 AM - 7:30 AM EST** | **How to Achieve Optimistic Updates with Blazor and EF Core**

In this session, you will learn how to implement optimistic updates with Blazor and Entity Framework Core (EF Core).

**10:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST** | **Building beautiful Blazor apps with Tailwind CSS**

If you're going to learn about Tailwind, you should hear it form expert Chris Sainty. 

**11:00 AM - 11:30 AM EST** | **Blazor-testing from A to Z**

Save time and increase your app's stability by unit testing your components. This session is presented by bUnit creator Egil Hansen.

**12:30 PM - 1:00 PM EST** | **Blazor Puzzles and Answers**

A fun session by two very entertaining individuals Jeffrey T. Fritz and Carl Franklin. Don't miss it.

**1:00 PM - 1:30 PM EST** | **Integrating Blazor with existing .NET web apps**

In this session I talk about how to transition your MVC, Razor Pages, and other app models to use Blazor's Razor Component architecture. Mixing and matching architectures is surprisingly effective and relatively easy.

**3:30 PM - 4:00 PM EST** | **Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 8**

This session is a great way to round out your ASP.NET Core skills. It's the least Blazor specific in my recommendations but still makes the list due to the importance of clean coding. Steve Smith is an excellent authority on the subject and wont disappoint.

## Conclusion

There are plenty of amazing sessions not listed here, make sure you revisit .NET Conf when the replays are posted online and catch the sessions you missed.
