## Cuban mojo chicken wraps with pineapple, roasted red pepper salsa

Sheri and I moved to Kentucky after living in Florida for most of our lives. We missed the Cuban food we were accustom to and started making our own. In 2010 I took my cooking skills to Louisville Master Chef, (then a local TV show) and won with this dish.

**Dinner**
A citrus marinated apple wood grilled chicken, wrapped in a tortilla and topped with smoked pineapple and roasted red pepper salsa.

## Drinks
